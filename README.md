## Implementation approach

The project has been implemented following the [clean code architecture described by uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

Main packages used:
*dependency injection* (get_it, injectable), *state management* (flutter_bloc), *functional programming* (dartz).

The lib folder structure is the following:

- lib/
    - core/ : contains tools(errors, utils, widgets) used globally in the project
    - features/ :  contains the main features of the app (absence manager)
    - di_config.dart : contains the configuration for the dependency injection
    - main.dart

The test folder structure is similar to the lib folder structure:

- test/
    - core/
    - features/
