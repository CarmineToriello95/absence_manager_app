The application has been implemented for **mobile devices**.
However, it is possible to test it on Github pages https://carminetoriello95.github.io/.

## Implementation Approach

I have applied changes to the api provided by the challenge in order to integrate it as a separate module within the project, ensuring modularity and enabling testing.

The project has been implemented following the [clean code architecture described by uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

Main packages used:
*dependency injection* (get_it, injectable), *state management* (flutter_bloc), *functional programming* (dartz), *testing* (mockito)

The lib folder structure is the following:

- lib/
    - core/ : contains tools(errors, utils, widgets) used globally in the project.
    - features/ :  contains the main features of the app. In this case it only contains the absence manager feature.
    - di_config.dart : contains the configuration for the dependency injection.
    - main.dart

The test folder structure is similar to the lib folder structure:

- test/
    - core/
    - features/
